# How To Use
Each individual Jupyter file is clearly annotated, and was designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible so that it may be edited and used by people who may not necessarily be technologically proficient. Just insert your desired values at the appropriate locations within the code cell, and press shift+enter to run the code (results will be printed inderneath the cell with code in it). All values are set to 0 at default.
A specific walkthrough will be provided for each of the applets below, so check there if you need any more help!
