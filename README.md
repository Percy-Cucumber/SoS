# SoS Applets by Percy_Cucumber
These are a series of applets to be used alongside the mobile game State of Survival. All code is written in Python 3 using Jupyter Notebook, and shared using GitHub and Binder for free unrestricted public use. Permission from the author required for any commercial use.

# How To Use
Each individual Jupyter file is clearly annotated, and was designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible so that it may be edited and used by people who may not necessarily be technologically proficient. Just follow the instructions below to get the desired files open within your web browser:
1) Click on the `Launch Binder` button -->  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Percy-Cucumber/SoS/HEAD).
2) You will be redirected to a binder page with a non-interactive preview of my GitHub SoS Repository on nbviewer. Just wait patiently for a server to be started for you. Your binder will open automatically when it is ready (this may take a bit depending on your device and network connection).
3) Once you've been redirected to your binder, you will find yourself looking at Percy_Cucumber's SoS Repository in Jupyter. Here you will find this readme document alongside all of the SoS applets (each as a .ipynb Jupyter file). Simply click on whichever Jupyter file you wish to open. A description of all available applets can be found below.
4) After you have opened an applet of your choice, insert your desired values at the appropriate locations within the code (every section is labeled using `# Commented Headers`. All values to be manually inserted are found in the top part of the code, and have been assigned with a default value of 0.
5) When you are content with the values you've inputted, press shift+enter to run the code. Alternatively, you can use the `▶︎|Run` button in the toolbar or either the `Run Cells` or `Run All` commands under the `cells` dropdown menu. Either way, the results will be printed inderneath the cell that has the code in it).
6) At any point you may go back into the cells to change out any of the numerical values, though you will need to re-run the code (see step 5) to re-print the new values.
If you need any farther assistance for which numerical values to update within each applet, check the applet's description below:
